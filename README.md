# beeper-nord-theme
Custom CSS that gives [Beeper](https://www.beeper.com) Nord colors

Made this in an afternoon so some of the ui that I don't use is probably not themed correctly.
This css file also changes the default font to Lexend. If you want to add your own font or use the default, delete or modify line 13.
